## What is built (detail)

### Phase 0 — Foundations 🟡
- ✅ DDD modular-monolith solution (.NET 10), `BuildingBlocks` (Domain/Application/Infrastructure/Web)
- ✅ CQRS pipeline: validation, logging, **authorization** behaviors; `Result`, `Specification`, `PredicateBuilder`, `PagedResult`, outbox entity
- ✅ API host (module composition, Swagger+bearer, ProblemDetails) + Worker host
- ✅ Docker Compose: Postgres/PostGIS, Redis, RabbitMQ, MinIO, Keycloak, api, worker, frontend(Nginx)
- ✅ EF Core migrations + dev auto-migrate; Serilog console logging
- ✅ **Transactional outbox**: SaveChanges interceptor writes domain events to per-context outbox
  tables; an `OutboxProcessor<TContext>` background service drains them and publishes in-process via
  MediatR (verified: seeded `OrgUnitCreated` events written + processed)
- ⬜ CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) — not yet
- ⬜ OpenTelemetry traces + Prometheus/Grafana metrics + Seq/Loki logs — not yet
- ⬜ Redis/MinIO not yet used in code; RabbitMQ delivery (Worker) is the future cross-service path

### Phase 1 — Identity, Org & Access ✅
- ✅ Org-unit tree (multi-level, create/list/search) — path stored as text
- ✅ Users (create/list/search) and Roles (create/list/search, permission sets)
- ✅ **Function-scope** authz (`IPermissionAuthorized` + pipeline behavior)
- ✅ **Data-scope** authz resolved from the user's assigned unit, **DB-driven** via a claims transformation
- ✅ Keycloak OIDC (realm import, SPA login/logout, API JWT validation, demo users)
- ✅ Dev seeder (org tree, ADMIN/SPECIALIST roles, `superadmin`/`chuyenvien`)
- ⬜ Reset-password-to-default (Keycloak admin API) — endpoint not built
- ⬜ Audit logging (audit behavior + AuditSystem context) — deferred to its own phase
- ⬜ `ltree` column type + GIST index (currently `text` + prefix match); update/delete endpoints

### Phase 2 — Catalog 🟡
- ✅ Versioned `Indicator` aggregate (Circular 33/2022) — create/list/search on `catalog` schema
- ⬜ Indicator sets (bộ chỉ tiêu), report templates, reporting periods, administrative-unit catalog, classification catalogs, batch import

### Phase 3 — Sector Data 🟡
- ✅ Generic `IndicatorObservation` aggregate (numeric stats by indicator + unit + period), data-scoped by unit
- ✅ `IndustrialCluster` rich entity with **PostGIS** Point geometry (SRID 4326) + GIST spatial index
- ✅ Data-scope by **org-unit id** (user's unit + descendants) — provider/claims now emit `scope_unit`
- ✅ **Market-violation cases** (hồ sơ vi phạm) — both groups (prohibited/counterfeit, food-safety),
  case lifecycle (reported → handling → resolved), data-scoped by unit
- ✅ **Petroleum stations** & **commerce locations** (markets/supermarkets/malls/convenience stores)
  — rich entities with PostGIS Point geometry; **e-commerce participants** (platforms + goods)
- ✅ `SectorData` module on its own `sector` schema (6 entity tables, 3 PostGIS geometry columns);
  create/list endpoints; registered in host
- ⬜ Excel/XML batch import; observation submit/approve workflow hooks; map view in UI

### Phase 4 — Reporting & Workflow 🟡
- ✅ `ReportingCampaign` (kỳ báo cáo) — create/list
- ✅ `ReportSubmission` **state machine**: Draft → Submitted → UnderReview → PendingApproval →
  Approved, with Return/Reject/Reopen; every transition guarded + recorded in owned history
- ✅ One action endpoint for all transitions; per-action permission (commune `submit`, specialist
  `review`, leader `approve`) enforced by the pipeline; data-scoped by unit
- ✅ `Reporting` module on its own `reporting` schema (campaign, report_submission, report_transition);
  domain events raised for each transition (`ReportStateChanged`)
- ✅ **Notification saga**: `ReportStateChanged` flows through the outbox to a **Notifications**
  context (own `notifications` schema) that records a notification; exposed via API + a header bell
  (unread badge) and notifications page
- ⬜ Per-user notification routing (currently a shared activity feed); RabbitMQ cross-service delivery
- ⬜ Bind report content to Catalog templates / SectorData observations (auto-extract)

### Phase 5 — Analytics & Dashboards 🟡
- ✅ `Analytics` context (read-only, no schema): CQRS read side via Dapper aggregate queries over the
  operational schemas, **data-scoped** by org unit (super-admin sees all)
- ✅ Endpoints: leadership **dashboard** (cross-domain counts), violations summary (by group/status +
  total fines), reporting summary (submissions by state)
- ⬜ Materialized views refreshed on events (currently live queries); charts; more aggregate reports
  (industry/commerce per Circular-34 templates); export

### Frontend
- ✅ **Light theme is the default for all pages**; auth-gated; bearer-token interceptor
- ✅ Pages: Org Units, Users, Roles, Indicators, Industrial Clusters, Observations, Market Violations,
  Petroleum Stations, Commerce Locations, E-commerce Participants (list / search / create)
- ✅ **Campaigns** + **Submissions** (workflow action buttons per state + transition-history timeline)
- ✅ **Notifications** page + header bell with unread badge
- ✅ **Dashboard** (landing page): statistic cards + reporting/violation breakdown tables
- ⬜ Edit & delete UI, detail views, interactive map (GIS), dashboards/charts

## Verification (current)
- `dotnet build` → 0 warnings / 0 errors; no known-vulnerable dependencies
- `dotnet test` → **31/31 pass** (domain + authorization + state-machine + notification handler)
- Outbox pipeline verified at runtime: seeded `OrgUnitCreated` events written to the outbox and
  drained by the processor (`total=2, processed=2`)
- `npm run build` (frontend) → OK
- Runtime smoke test → `identity` + `catalog` + `sector` schemas migrate, dev seed applies, PostGIS
  geometry column + GIST index created, all endpoints reject anonymous callers (401)

## Next up
- **AuditSystem** context — audit log of all actions (a Level-3 requirement) + an audit pipeline
  behavior; the file/resource (MinIO) module
- Phase 6 — **Integration** (LGSP/NDXP connectors + connection-status API)
- Cross-cutting backlog: CI/CD pipeline, OpenTelemetry/metrics, per-user notification routing,
  materialized views + charts, interactive map view (GIS), Excel/XML import
